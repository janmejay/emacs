# Disable the mouse in Emacs

Want to force yourself to use the keyboard in Emacs, and you don't
have a cat available to obstruct your trackpad? Use this local or
global minor mode to suppress the default mouse behaviours.

## Installation

### Manual

Ensure `disable-mouse.el` is in a directory on your load-path, and
add the following to your `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
(require 'disable-mouse)
(global-disable-mouse-mode)
```

If you use Evil, this may be insufficient, since the keymaps for
Evil's individual states will contain bindings for mouse
events. `disable-mouse` provides a function `disable-mouse-in-keymap`
which you can use to neutralise any keymap, so Evil users might use a
snippet like the following in addition to that above:

```elisp
(mapc #'disable-mouse-in-keymap
  (list evil-motion-state-map
        evil-normal-state-map
        evil-visual-state-map
        evil-insert-state-map))
```

Note that you won't be able to restore those Evil mouse bindings by turning off
`disable-mouse-mode`. You'll need to restart Emacs instead.

### MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of
`package.el` you can install `disable-mouse` from the
[MELPA](http://melpa.org) repository. The version of
`disable-mouse` there will always be up-to-date.

Enable `global-disable-mouse-mode` with `M-x global-disable-mouse-mode`, by using
the customisation interface, or by adding code such as the following
to your emacs startup file:

```elisp
(global-disable-mouse-mode)
```

If you want to only disable the mouse in only a certain mode, add
`disable-mouse-mode` to that mode's hook.

After writing this, I found
[handoff](https://github.com/rejeep/handoff.el), which has a similar
goal, but aims for more annoyance and frivolity.
