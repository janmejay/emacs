	* lisp/tla+-mode.el (tla+-java-path):
	(tla+-dot-binary):
	remove some default paths that may be not useful or
	helpful for other users.
	(tla+-run-sany):
	(tla+-run-model):
	(tla+-run-pluscal):
	(tla+-run-tlatex):
	(tla+-run-model): add an error check (if the
	tla+-tlatools-path is not set, print an error message)
	(tla+-run-dot): run dot only when the binary to dot
	is given.

	* org/Test.org: add an example org file.
	this shows the usage of org-babel-tangle in
	combination with TLA+ (it may be used to
	further comment on TLA+ specifications).

	* lisp/tla+-mode.el: update URLs, remove
	unnecessary comments, cleanup whitespace and
	wrap lines.
	(tlc-widget-example): if a TLC cfg already
	exists, copy it to .old.<seconds>.  erase
	the buffer then and insert the new TLC
	config into the buffer.
	Add the current time to the tlc config.

	* lisp/tla+-mode.el (tla+-tlc-depth): tune depth
	parameter, default to 1000 now.
	(tla+-tlc-workers): tune worker threads (at least
	2 threads should be used by default)
	(tla+-dot-convert, tla+-dot-binary): dot(1)
	customization variables.
	(tla+-run-dot): elisp function to run dot(1) and
	convert the state graph to a PNG file
	(tla+-run-model): automatically generate the PNG
	output file, change  the window handling.  It
	seems better to only show the tlc buffer output
	once (when it is a newly created buffer).  The
	user may kill it, or arrange it in such a way
	that the output can be read by another tlc model
	check run.  Also: set the bufffer to readonly.
	(tlc-widget-example): remove the cfgname; seems
	that the lambda expressions do not see the cfgname
	anyway so I have to reconstruct it.
